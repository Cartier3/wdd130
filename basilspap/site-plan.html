      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Basil’s Pasta and Pizzeria has proven over the last 7 years that we are a dedicated and efficient Italian restaurant service. Right now, our company is doing great business-wise, but we have not expanded our restaurant’s services far out enough around the U.S. 
        But what if we were able to expand our service throughout the vast regions of the internet. 
        My name is Carter Hart, I am a front-end web developer, I am proposing that we create a new website to promote Basil’s Pasta and Pizzeria to a wider audience. 
        Our new website will contain a menu of all the current dishes our restaurant is currently serving based on the customer’s community preference. 
        The website will also contain an ordering section where customers can order their food and come pick it up from our restaurant. We also plan to include restaurant loyalty perks that are available on our website. 
      </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience consists of any individual who is over the age of 3 years old.
         Our audience is made up of many people who want quality, hand-crafted Italian food that satisfies their appetite. 
         Our audience also wants quality service that is quick, affordable, and efficient to meet their lifestyles. 
         Our audience also wants clean and appealing restaurant buildings that complement our quality food. 
         Our audience also wants a restaurant website that  complements our restaurant and is easy to navigate and order from.
